There are three notebook files for this project
1) EnergyConsumptionPrediction-EDA : Contains the exploratory data analysis and some minor preprocessing
2) Energy_Usage_Modelling_DecisionTree : Contains pipeline and data science modelling using decision tree
2) Energy_Usage_Modelling_GradientBoosting : Contains pipeline and data science modelling using gradient boosting
