Goal of this project is to predict the mean energy consumption of buildings. Features mainly used for this process include building and population characteristics

There are three notebook files for this project
1) EnergyConsumptionPrediction-EDA.ipynb : Contains the exploratory data analysis and some minor preprocessing
2) Energy_Usage_Modelling_DecisionTree.ipynb : Contains pipeline and data science modelling using decision tree
3) Energy_Usage_Modelling_GradientBoosting.ipynb : Contains pipeline and data science modelling using gradient boosting
4) Energy_Usage_2010.csv : Contains the dataset downloaded from the above dataset link
5) Energy_Usage_2010_preprocessed.csv : Contains the preprocessed data from EnergyConsumptionPrediction-EDA.ipynb notebook
